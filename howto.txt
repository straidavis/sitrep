How to Assemble & Deploy
Once both builds are complete, you will have:

Server Executable: 
c:\sitrep\server\dist\sitrep-server.exe
Client Executable: 
c:\sitrep\client\dist_electron\Aircraft Materiel Condition Report 1.0.0.exe
 (or similar name)
Configuration File: 
c:\sitrep\client\sitrep-config.json
To deploy, create a folder (e.g., C:\SITREP) and:

Copy both executables into this folder.
Copy sitrep-config.json into this same folder.
Edit sitrep-config.json to match your desired environment:
Set "authMode": "local" or "microsoft".
Set "serverUrl": "http://localhost:3001" (if running local server) or your Azure URL.
Run the Server EXE first (if using Local Server).
Run the Client EXE. It will read the config file from the folder and connect accordingly.
