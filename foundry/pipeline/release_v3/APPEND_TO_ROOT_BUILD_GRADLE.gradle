// ============================================================
// CRITICAL FIX: MISSING 'patch' TASK
// ============================================================
// The build system is trying to run a task named 'patch', but it is not defined.
// You MUST append this code to the BOTTOM of your root 'build.gradle' file.

task patch {
    doLast {
        println("Patch task running... (Manually added fix)")
    }
}
