To deploy, create a folder (e.g., C:\SITREP) and:

Copy both executables into this folder.
Copy sitrep-config.json into this same folder.
Edit sitrep-config.json to match your desired environment:
Set "authMode": "local" or "microsoft".
Set "serverUrl": "http://localhost:3001" (if running local server) or your Azure URL.
Run the Server EXE first (if using Local Server).
Run the Client EXE. It will read the config file from the folder and connect accordingly.
